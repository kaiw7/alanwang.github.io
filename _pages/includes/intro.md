# ðŸŽŠ Welcome to my website!

My name is Kai (Alan) Wang. I'm a Ph.D candidate at The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. [Dimitrios Hatzinakos](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~dimitris/). I also work closely with Prof. [Yapeng Tian](https://www.yapengtian.com/) on Audio-Visual Learning and Generation. 

My research interests lie in  **Multimodal Learning (Image/Video/Audio)**, **Generative Models**, and **Multimodal LLM**. &ensp;&ensp;<a href='https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=dBVSZWAAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fkaiw7%2Fkaiw7.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
